The Soviet Psychologist [[Lev Vygotsky]] came up with the theory of [[Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD)]]. It states that if a task is very easy for a person to do, he learns nothing, and if a task is very hard for a person to do, he still learns nothing. 

So in the spectrum of difficulty, there's an optimum zone, which [[Lev Vygotsky]] calls the [[Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD)]], where a person faces enough challenge that it is not overwhelming, but not also so easy that is becomes boring. 

I can recall some recent instances where I experiences both the extreme ends. With regards to it being very hard, I'll say the CVIT conference in IIIT Hyderabad which I attended with [[Sunil Kulkarni]] was one such instance, where I was able to keep up in the start, but as the conference delved deep into the mathematics of Neural Network and various architectures, I fell back as the challenge was too much for me.

But regarding an instance where the learning activity or task was too easy for me, I can't even recall one, because in such instances no learning happened for me to identify it as an easy learning instance. But most of the experiences I would relate to this type are related to me getting bored in the first moments after starting any learning activity, the most recent one being a course on [[Langchain]].

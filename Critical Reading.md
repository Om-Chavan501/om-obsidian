### **Critical Reading Tips**

- Approach the content from a distance
	- Don't let your eyes glaze over
	- Perform [[Metacognition]] - Look for connections with your previous existing knowledge
	- Ask what the *Argument* or *Idea* is. Ask what *Appeal* is being used, what *Evidence* is being presented, what *Story* is being presented.
	- Ask if it's *right, true or persuasive*.
- Keep an eye out for Key Terms and Definitions, as well as Key Events and People and the relationships between all of them.
- For Persuasive types of literature like Philosophy, stop and ask yourself:
	- What is the problem that has been identified?
	- Do I agree with this premise or basic statement
- Along with evaluating sentences, you also want to evaluate larger arguments, metaphors, images....
	- Mark out or plot all the steps in an argument in order to scrutinise it or even recreate it later.
	- An argument is a chain or relationships between statements that flow in a single direction and end with a conclusion.
- Don't blindly accept everything you read.
- To test your understanding, try to summarise the text in jargon free ordinary language in less than a minute
- What are the flaws or blind spots in the argument as well as what are the strengths and insights.
- Active reading means not skimming over words or concepts you don't know. You should look them up, not just the definition but also the etymology or origin of words.

> *conversation with the finest people of* 
> *the past centuries"*

- Whenever you want to pick up anything to read, make the harder choice

While working in office, I usually tend to be very quick, chaotic and haphazard with my actions when it comes to navigating through a laptop. The seniors who work on tasks that require smooth handling have gotten a macbook pro for better tasks. 

[[Vedant Bhagat]] has been a senior by 6 months due to him joining the team earlier. He has accomplished some achievements. And hence, the attraction and need for a macbook is often expressed by him. But once when I was working very quickly through tasks, he openly stated that "Bro, you need a Mac more than I do.". It was stated in a matter of fact way, but it showed humility and genuineness. There was no hint of [[Insecurities]] in this statement. 

Such acts of genuine appreciation can mean a lot, and it establishes you as the humble and genuine person, as well as a good and honest observer.

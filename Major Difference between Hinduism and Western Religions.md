In a reel I saw of [[J Sai Deepak]] he talks about the Major Difference between Hinduism and Western Religions. He starts with the concept of Polytheism, belief in the existence of multiple deities. This in itself means that everyone has the freedom and the choice to choose whom to believe in and whom to worship. i.e. You do not believe in imposing one god on everybody else. Which means that there's an inherent acceptance for diversity.

When there's this freedom, it means that there's nothing being imposed on anyone. A basic reasoning could be that if someone is different in their beliefs than you, then by definition you would be uncomfortable with them. But India is a home to such a huge diversity and in our everyday lives we never feel uncomfortable with our fellow Indians who are from various geological and cultural and intellectual backgrounds. This ease of living comes from an essential acceptance of the concept of freedom and a high importance to the being of an individual.

Hence, all the previous direct, and current indirect passive aggressive attempts of the foreign forces to highlight this diversity and try to create a rift in this goes directly against the values of humanity. And they say they want to teach us diversity.
